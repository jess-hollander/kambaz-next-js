## 📝 Important Notes

1. **Questions are embedded in Quiz documents** - When you fetch a quiz, questions come with it
2. **Automatic scoring** - Backend calculates score when student submits attempt
3. **Session required** - All attempt endpoints require authenticated user
4. **Points calculation** - Update quiz.points when questions change
5. **Date handling** - Use JavaScript Date objects, backend stores as ISO strings
6. **WYSIWYG editors** - Store HTML in question.question field
7. **Answer format**:
   - Multiple Choice: string (selected choice text)
   - True/False: boolean
   - Fill in Blank: string (case-insensitive comparison on backend)
